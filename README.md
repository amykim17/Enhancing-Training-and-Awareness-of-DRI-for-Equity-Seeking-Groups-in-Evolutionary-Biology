## Enhancing Training and Awareness of DRI for Equity Seeking Groups in Evolutionary Biology

This project will be a central and public resource for all evolutionary biologists that contains important theoretical background knowledge, training materials, and current research in the field. This projectâ€™s goal is to provide individuals from all walks of life to have free and open access to crucial knowledge and materials in evolutionary biology and to create a community of students, researchers, and teachers.

- **Vision:** One sentence capturing the project's overarching vision.
- **Mission:** One sentence defining the project's goals and target audience.

## About

We are a group of evolutionary biologists from the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia situated on the lands of the Musqueam First Nation. We are motivated to help budding and equity-seeking biologists, who do not have free and open access to important resources, to assist them in their scientific journey. We hope that this website will be a safe and welcoming environment for individuals to learn, explore, and collaborate.
